# Tactix

Tic Tac Toe, but you only get 3 moves. Then… you move them.

Welcome to Tactix — a strategic remix of the classic game where Xs and Os don’t just sit there. Once you've placed your 3 signs, the real game begins. Slide them around the board, outwit your opponent, and prepare for maximum pettiness.

💡 What You Can Do

- Play 1v1 or challenge the AI (from Easy to Impossible)
- Only 3 pieces per player — once placed, you move them
- Choose from 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, or go infinite (chaos)

🎮 Game Modes

- 👥 Player vs Player
- 🧠 AI: Easy / Normal / Hard / Nightmare / Impossible

🛠️ Tech Stack
| Layer | Tech |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Styling | Cyberpunk gradients + glitch FX |
| Language | TypeScript |

🚀 How It Works

- Click to place your sign — max 3 allowed
- Once maxed, click your piece to select it, then move it
- Win by lining up 3 — unless your opponent moves them first
- Glitch animations make transitions ✨ extra ✨

🔧 In Progress

- AI logic for all difficulty modes
- Win tracking/history and leaderboard
- Custom board builder
